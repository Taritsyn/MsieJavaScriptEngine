   ===========
   DESCRIPTION
   ===========
   This library is a .NET wrapper for working with the JavaScript engines of
   Internet Explorer and Edge (JsRT versions of Chakra, ActiveScript version of
   Chakra and Classic JavaScript Engine). Project was based on the code of
   SassAndCoffee.JavaScript (http://github.com/paulcbetts/SassAndCoffee),
   Chakra Sample Hosts (http://github.com/panopticoncentral/chakra-host) and
   jsrt-dotnet (http://github.com/robpaveza/jsrt-dotnet).

   =============
   RELEASE NOTES
   =============
   Fixed a error that occurred during the recursive execution and evaluation of JS
   files (while without correct handling of host exceptions).
